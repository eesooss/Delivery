# Delivery

This is a description of my training project on Java. The aim of this project is to demonstrate Java programming concepts and techniques to beginners developers who want to learn or improve their Java skills.

We welcome any feedback and suggestions on this project, so please feel free to open an issue. Thank you for your interest in my educational project on Java!

## Features

-   The program displays a string with product information in the format "Product: [product name], Category: [product category], Price: [product price]"

## Technologies Used

-   Java 19.0.2

## Requirements

-   Install the latest version of Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
-   Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the directory where JDK is installed. For example, on Windows, you can set it using the following command in the Command Prompt: `setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_301"` (replace the directory path with the actual path on your system).

## Usage

-   Download the source code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eesooss/Hangman).
-   Extract the source code to a directory of your choice.
-   Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted the source code.
-   Compile the source code by running the following command: `javac -d bin src/*.java` (this assumes that your source code files are located in the `src` directory and the compiled files will be placed in the `bin` directory).
-   Run the project by running the following command: `java -cp bin Application`.
